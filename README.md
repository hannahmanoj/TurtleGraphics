# TurtleGraphics

This is a Java project developed as part of my university coursework. It demonstrates key programming concepts and fundamentals, including object-oriented programming (OOP). It's a graphical Java application as part of a university project that simulates a turtle graphics
environment using the OOPGraphics framework. The application allows users to input commands to
control a "turtle" that can draw various shapes, change pen colours, and adjust pen width on a canvas.
