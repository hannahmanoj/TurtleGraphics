# 🐢 TurtleGraphics

This is a graphical Java application made as part of a university project that simulates a turtle graphics
environment using the OOPGraphics framework. The application allows users to input commands to
control a "turtle" that can draw various shapes, change pen colours, and adjust pen width on a canvas.
